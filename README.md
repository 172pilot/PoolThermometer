# PoolThermometer
Wifi connected DS18B20 via 8266 microcontroller


Bunch of sample codes I stole and added together to build a remote thermometer for my pool to report to Hubitat through the Maker API

The 8266 hangs safely outside of the pool, and the wires to the DS18B20 go through a PVC "U" shaped pipe to hang in the water.
